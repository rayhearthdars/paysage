# A landscape where a character moves upon mouse click.

## Project Description

This was an exercise in using the p5.js library. You need to download the library for my code to work. Here is a link to it: https://p5js.org/ 

I created a landscape, with clouds going by, and a small stylized human that 
moves along the path on mouse click and slowly becomes smaller the farther he goes.

It was difficult to keep track of every coordinate.

Also, at first, I created my functions directly in the draw function which made it a pretty big mess. 
Someone pointed out a better way for me and that was to create my functions in the global scope and to call them in the draw function.
